# genetic-grouping-algorightm
Genetic grouping algorithm for assembly line balancing. Developed as the Master's work.

Developed using SFML library (https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

Assembly line balancing consists of optimizing workstations load following these rules:
1) No workstation can operate longer than some predetermined cycle time C;
2) No precedence constraints are violated for any task;
3) The goal is to have the least amount of workstations.

Genetic operators were modified as described by Falkenauer (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.51.7312&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
